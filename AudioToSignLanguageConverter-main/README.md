# AudioToSignLanguageConverter

The aim of this project is to design a convenient system that is helpful for the people who
have hearing difficulties and in general who use a very simple and effective method; sign
language. This system can be used for converting sign language to voice and also voice
to sign language. A motion capture system is used for sign language conversion and a
voice recognition system for voice conversion. It captures the signs and dictates on the
screen as writing. It also captures the voice and displays the sign language meaning on
the screen as image or video.
Speech Recognition is an important feature in several applications used, such as home
automation, artificial intelligence, etc. This python project aims to provide an introduction
on how to make use of speech recognition in Python along with the language translator.
For this, we have to download or install several libraries of Python language.
It includes:
● Python Speech recognition module
● PyAudio
● Python image and image plotting modules
● Microphone, etc.

Keywords: Speech recognition, Indian sign language, image processing.
